    <div class="gaye">Why frontend is important,frontend is important as it connects two crrucial areas:the website design(vision,look,feel,personality of the site).The front end is a crucial component of web development, encompassing everything that users interact with directly in their web browsers. Here’s why it's so important:
        1. First Impressions Matter
        User Experience (UX): The front end is the first thing users see and interact with. A well-designed, intuitive interface can significantly enhance user satisfaction and retention.
        Visual Appeal: Attractive and modern designs help in creating a positive impression, which can influence users’ perception of a brand or product.
        2. Usability and Accessibility
        Ease of Use: Good front-end design ensures that the website or application is easy to navigate, making it simpler for users to find information and perform tasks.
        Accessibility: Proper front-end development ensures that content is accessible to people with disabilities, adhering to standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
